                                  <p><strong>4. What is Personal Data?</strong></p>
                                  <p>Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.</p>
                                  <p>Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>
                                  <p><strong>5. What Are My Rights?</strong></p>
                                  <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:</p>
                                  <ul class="term-condition-ul">

                                    <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 13 will tell you how to do this.</li>

                                    <li>The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we have. Please contact us using the details in Part 15 to find out more.</li>

                                  <p>Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>
                                  <p>If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>

                                  <p>Under the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data.

                                  <p><strong>9. How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</strong></p>
                                  <p>We may store or transfer some or all of your personal data in countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (the “EEA” consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). These are known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR as follows.</p>
                                  <p>We share your data within the group of companies of which we are<b> </b>a part. Where this involves the transfer of personal data outside the EEA, our group ensures that personal data is protected by requiring all companies within the group to follow the same rules with respect to personal data usage. These are known as “binding corporate rules”. More information on binding corporate rules is available from the <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/binding-corporate-rules_en" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0563c1;">European Commission</span></a></span>.</p>
                                  <p><strong>10. Do You Share My Personal Data?</strong></p>
                                  <p>We may share your personal data with other companies in our group for marketing purpose(s). This includes subsidiaries and our holding company and its subsidiaries.</p>
                                  <p>We may sometimes contract with the following third parties to supply certain products and services. These may include payment processing, delivery, and marketing. In some cases, those third parties may require access to some or all of your personal data that we hold.</p>
                                  <ul class="term-condition-ul">
                                    <li>Google – Data Analytics;</li>

                                  <p>If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR, as explained above in Part 9.</p>
                                  <p>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>
                                  <p><strong>11. How Can I Control My Personal Data?</strong></p>

                                  <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.</p>

                                  <p>We will respond to your subject access request within 28 days and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
